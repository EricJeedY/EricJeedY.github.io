            On June 23, 2016, Boston Dynamics revealed the four-legged canine-inspired Spot, weighing 25 kg (55 pounds), which was lighter than their other products.
            Spot is changing how organizations monitor and operate their sites, ensure the safety of their teams, and make data-driven decisions. Put Spot's unprecedented agility and advanced autonomy to work and extend the reach of your team.

            <h2 style="" id="sub1-intro2">
                In November 2017, a promotional video of Spot using its forward claw to open a door for another robot reached #1 on YouTube, with over 2 million views. A later video the same month showed Spot persisting in attempting to open the door in the face of human interference. Viewers perceived the robot as "creepy" and "reminiscent of all kinds of sci-fi robots that wouldn't give up in their missions to seek and destroy".

                Spot is easy to use and intuitive to learn, making it quick to deploy for both manual operations and autonomous missions. You can generate immediate value for your organization with pre-configured packages for inspection, research, and hazardous response. Or, if you want to think out-of-the box, Spot's 14kg of payload capacity, robust API, and comprehensive documentation allow you to equip it for your specific needs no matter your application.
