            <h2 style="" id="news1">
            Over 1,500 Spot robots have been deployed around the world to proactively monitor industrial equipment for signs of failure. One of the biggest ways companies are realizing value with Spot today is acoustic leak detection—with typical customers seeing return-on-investment in two years or less. Operators collect data using Spot and the Fluke SV600 acoustic imager to perform predictive maintenance—avoiding unplanned downtime and reducing costly inefficiencies.

                Atlas is autonomously moving engine covers between supplier containers and a mobile sequencing dolly. The robot receives as input a list of bin locations to move parts between. 

Atlas uses a machine learning (ML) vision model to detect and localize the environment fixtures and individual bins [0:36]. The robot uses a specialized grasping policy and continuously estimates the state of manipulated objects to achieve the task.

            <h2 style="" id="news3">
                The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion than any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.
